The Straight Edge Superstar made his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shocking return</a> at Survivor Series: WarGames 2023. Punk showed up to a huge pop from the Chicago crowd at the All State Arena.</p><p>He cut his first WWE promo in 10 years on RAW. While Punk didn’t name-drop his first opponent, he did tease a potential feud with reigning World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins. After all, the Visionary did reference CM Punk’s return during his promo earlier during the show.</p><p>It seems fans might’ve to wait till RAW next week to find out the Second City Saint’s first opponent. In the meantime, let’s take a look at the five best options for CM Punk’s first WWE feud in a decade:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Dominik Mysterio is the most hated superstar on the WWE roster</h2><p>Dominik Mysterio has had exceptional career growth during the past one year. The Judgment Day star has cemented himself as arguably the most hated heel on the roster. He’s improved his in-ring performance by working on televised shows, live events, and premium live events.</p><p>What’s more, Dominik main evented RAW against Randy Orton in the Viper’s comeback match on the red brand in 18 months. This shows the trust Triple H has in the young star. A feud between Dominik and CM Punk can potentially elevate the young star to even greater heights.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Drew McIntyre turned heel not too long ago</h2><p>Drew McIntyre has had one of the most justified heel turns in recent memory. The Scottish Warrior was humiliated in front of his family and friends at Clash at the Castle 2022. He watched as Seth Rollins practically handed the world title opportunity to Jey Uso, the man responsible for costing McIntyre so many matches against Roman Reigns.</p><p>Ideally, McIntyre would think of Punk as an outsider who’s returned to hijack the spotlight from homegrown stars like this. This uneasy feeling would then cause the former two-time WWE Champion to confront the Second City Saint. Plus, they’d both want a shot at Seth Rollins and the World Heavyweight Championship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>AJ Styles and CM Punk have a storied history</h2><p>AJ Styles has a storied history with CM Punk outside of WWE. The duo have had classics on the independent circuit. That being said, Styles and Punk do not like each other. They have traded barbs on social media in the past. WWE has done incredibly well under Triple H when it comes to using real-life heat for in-ring storytelling. CM Punk’s real-life heat with AJ Styles could be tied into a potential storyline between them.</p><p>The Phenomenal One has yet to return to WWE SmackDown from his storyline injury with The Bloodline. Ideally, Jimmy Uso and Solo Sikoa would be his first target, but WWE can save the storyline for the latter and capitalize on Punk’s purported free agent status to set up a feud between him and Styles.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Kevin Owens needs a singles program on WWE SmackDown</h2><p>Kevin Owens and Seth Rollins have similar opinions on CM Punk. They both do not like the Straight Edge Superstar. Owens’ issue with Punk allegedly stems from their time working together on the indies, and Owens’ friendship with the Young Bucks. The Prizefighter is currently involved in a storyline with Grayson Waller and Austin Theory on SmackDown.</p><p>That being said, GM Nick Aldis can put CM Punk and Kevin Owens in a huge storyline on SmackDown. The Second City Saint can potentially show up on the blue brand this Friday. He could have an interaction of sorts with Kevin Owens to set up a program between them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2023/11/Seth-Rollins-CM-Punk.jpg><h2>Seth Rollins versus CM Punk seems to be the plan for now</h2><p>Seth Rollins was livid to see CM Punk at Survivor Series: WarGames 2023. Later reports revealed the Visionary did a great job selling his reaction to his former opponent’s epic comeback in the sports entertainment juggernaut.</p><p>Seth Rollins versus CM Punk has been brewing for a long, long time. The World Heavyweight Champion thinks Punk is a hypocrite. Punk has already begun to play along by referencing Rollins’ comments on RAW this past Monday.</p><p>There are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">conflicting reports</a> as to when this match is set to take place, with some suggesting it could either happen at the Royal Rumble or WrestleMania 40. Whatever the stage, this has the potential to be one of the greatest feuds of the Triple H era.</p><h2 id=h-honorable-mentions>Honorable Mentions</h2><p>Gunther – CM Punk and Gunther can square off against each other for the Ring General’s Intercontinental Championship.</p><p>Finn Balor – The Irish Superstar has had an incredible 2023. Balor has given some excellent matches and his heel work has been nothing but top notch.</p><p>Austin Theory – The former United States Championship needs a solid program to regain his pre-WrestleMania momentum. Theory can learn a lot from a feud with CM Punk.</p><p>Karrion Kross – The Doom Walker hasn’t had a meaningful feud since Drew McIntyre in 2022. Kross has had wins against the likes of Shinsuke Nakamura and AJ Styles. He and Punk could deliver a solid program if they work together.</p><p>Solo Sikoa – The Enforcer of The Bloodline has passed every test that’s come his way. He’s destroyed every opponent that’s stepped up to him. Plus, his association with Paul Heyman is something that can be tied into a storyline with CM punk.</p><p>: <a href=#>CM Punk’s 5 Best WWE Feuds</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZpudo6l6uL7ErKuloZ6cfHKAkW5sb29danqjsdKtZKiopJ68r7%2BMn6arZZOierHBzaSqZp6Zp8C1edawnGaelaqx</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./did-daniel-radcliffe-really-sign-a-baby-contract-with-j-k-rowling.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Daniel Radcliffe really sign a baby contract with J.K.
