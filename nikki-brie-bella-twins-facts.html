Following that, when they were in third grade, their mom put them in separate classes to give them a bit of space. Though they shared a friend group, they had different best friends. Still, there was always a connection. “They could sense each other's feelings and would sustain similar injuries at the same time or within weeks of each other,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://archive.azcentral.com/thingstodo/events/articles/20100317bella-twins-enjoying-wwe-success.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="AZCentral wrote" data-vars-ga-product-id=7fa3bac3-82bf-4789-b38b-cbe0559b0599 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=http://archive.azcentral.com/thingstodo/events/articles/20100317bella-twins-enjoying-wwe-success.html data-product-url=http://archive.azcentral.com/thingstodo/events/articles/20100317bella-twins-enjoying-wwe-success.html data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-brand="Not a Subscriber?" data-vars-ga-product-price=$24.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=cd92a566-cd29-4ab8-9217-11e72a65ac1d data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Not a Subscriber?" class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">AZCentral wrote</a>. “They often finish each other's sentences.”</p><img alt="Brie Bella" title="Brie Bella" width=3744 height=5616 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-175616624.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Brie Bella; Photo: Lizzy Sullivan/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The sisters were both soccer stars</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Soccer became one of their common outlets, as they both started playing in fifth grade and then continued playing competitively for 11 years. “I snapped my tibia on the field senior year in high school which wasn’t fun, but never stopped the love for soccer,” Nikki said on Fox Sports’ <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wwe.com/videos/the-bella-twins-reveal-how-soccer-has-influenced-them data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Soccer Tonight" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Soccer Tonight</a>.

And so we did it!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nikki said the global lockdown definitely spurred on the move: “I will say the one thing COVID taught me was to simplify my life, and in all areas...For me it was like seeing beautiful parts of the world, having amazing experiences and new memories with my family." And of course, they did it together, with Nikki adding: “It was definitely a twin decision — our poor guys!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYraCcmsGmv46noKSjmWKvs7XEZpmepJyWerXDyKeqZp6RmMG0</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lil-wayne-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lil Wayne Net Worth: Lifestyle &amp;amp; Cars</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vaneza-oliveira-boyfriend-3-wiki-height-age-family-parents-instagram.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Vaneza Oliveira Boyfriend (3%) Wiki, Height, Age, Family, Parents, Instagram</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelor-in-paradise-aaron-bryant-and-eliza-isichei-break-up-1555224468.html>Bachelor in Paradise Aaron Bryant and Eliza Isichei Break Up</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-baldwin-about-the-author.html>James Baldwin Biography and Quotes | James Baldwin Biography | American Masters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-best-paramore-lyrics-about-self-discovery.html>The best Paramore lyrics about Self-discovery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-rachel-maddow-david-maddow-siblings-find-more-about-the-brother-of-american-television-news-program-host.html>Are Rachel Maddow &amp;amp; David Maddow Siblings?
