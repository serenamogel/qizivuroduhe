They’re just too delicious to not have in your side dish rotation, especially in the fall. These mashed sweet potatoes have a beautifully smooth and creamy texture, and I season them with garlic, ginger, and rosemary to create a rich, warm flavor that’s part savory, part sweet. But maybe best of all, this mashed sweet potato recipe is SO easy to make! It calls for 8 ingredients, and the oven takes care of most of the work for you. It’s a…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Let’s talk buffalo sauce! This famous wing sauce is rich, tangy, and spicy. I recently tested out a homemade version for this buffalo cauliflower recipe, and I love the bold flavor so much that I’ve been using it in other ways too. As a dip for sweet potato fries or air fryer French fries, slathered on a black bean burger… If you love punchy flavors and lots of heat, then I think you’ll go nuts for this buffalo sauce recipe. But I’m getting ahead of myself. What is buffalo sauce, anyway? I’ll start by saying that it has nothing to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Ok,&nbsp;maybe a copycat Chipotle sofritas recipe is a little past due around here (I think sofritas first came out in like, 2014??), but hey! It was worth the wait! Coated in a blend of roasted veggies, spices, and chipotle peppers, these homemade tofu sofritas are saucy, spicy, and packed with plant-based protein. Just like Chipotle’s, they’re a satisfying addition to a burrito or bowl, but, in my opinion, they taste even better. But first thing’s first: What are sofritas, anyway? Sofritas are a vegan protein option at Chipotle Mexican Grill. According to this article, they originated as a collaboration between…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I first tried this Instant Pot rice recipe last fall, and to be honest, I don’t think I’ve cooked rice any other way since. Nothing against the stovetop or the rice cooker, of course, but the convenience and reliable results of this Instant Pot rice recipe just can’t be beat. It’s super quick and easy, and the rice comes out tender, fluffy, and flavorful every time. If you have an Instant Pot, you have to try it! How to Make Instant Pot Rice This recipe couldn’t be simpler! To make it, you’ll need two ingredients: White rice Water This recipe…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I’ve had a stash of this acorn squash soup in my freezer for the last couple of weeks, ready and waiting for the type of cold fall day that necessitates creamy orange soup. Well, last weekend, that day finally came. Saturday arrived, chilly and crisp, and I knew that this acorn squash soup would hit the spot. I heated up a bowl for lunch, and I enjoyed it so much that I polished off the rest on Sunday. This weekend, I’m definitely making more. This acorn squash soup is sublimely creamy (but not from cream!), and it’s deliciously seasoned with…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>A good sweet potato hash will always be one of my favorite things to eat. I love the balance of sweet, smoky, and spicy flavors. I love how the tender veggies and sweet potatoes get deliciously crispy on the bottom of the hot skillet. But perhaps most of all, I love that a sweet potato hash is a healthy, one-pan meal that I can easily pull off in 30 minutes. This sweet potato hash recipe is my go-to. It’s nicely spiced with chili powder and packed with veggies like peppers and kale. It’s a great simple meal to have in…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This Instant Pot chili delivers everything you love about regular chili–a smoky tomato broth, tender peppers, and hearty beans–but it has the added bonus of being a set-it-and-forget-it recipe. I won’t argue that regular chili is difficult to make (I call my recipe Easy Vegetarian Chili, after all), but it does require you to stay nearby the kitchen if not in it, close enough to adjust the heat of your stove from time to time to maintain a lively simmer. For most of my life, I loved that aspect of making chili or soup. I wanted to hang out in…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This Instant Pot pinto beans recipe has become my favorite way to cook pinto beans. It’s faster than simmering them on the stove (no soaking required!), but it still yields beans with a far better texture and flavor than the canned ones have. These Instant Pot pinto beans are tender, creamy, and deliciously seasoned with chili powder, cumin, oregano, and sea salt. They’re so tasty that you can serve them as a side dish on their own, but we love them in other recipes too. Try adding them to chili or soup, or use them to make tacos, refried beans,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>The next time you’re craving a pumpkin spice latte, save yourself a trip to a coffee shop, and make this recipe at home! By October, I always feel like I should share some kind of pumpkin-y treat on the blog, and this year, I thought a homemade version of the Starbucks pumpkin spice latte would be fun. I know it’s a bit of a fall cliché at this point, so I was surprised by how much I ended up loving this recipe. Creamy, cozy, and lightly sweet, it’s warming and comforting on a cool fall morning or crisp afternoon. It’s…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Tortilla soup is one of my favorite foods. Not just one of my favorite soups (though of course it is), but one of my favorite foods in general. I love how the rich, flavorful broth contrasts with toppings like crunchy tortilla strips and creamy avocado. Now that the temperatures are cooling off for the season, you can bet that I’ll have this tortilla soup recipe on repeat. Tortilla soup (or sopa de tortilla or sopa Azteca) is thought to have originated in central Mexico, though you can find regional variations throughout Mexico and the US today. I can’t claim that…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This enchiladas recipe is the kind of simple, comforting dish that we all need in our weeknight rotations. It’s easy, it’s flavorful, and it will win over the pickiest palates (our kiddo always asks for more!). The filling is a combo of gooey cheese, black beans, and steamed spinach. I roll it up in corn tortillas, which I then smother with homemade enchilada sauce and more cheese. Finally, I bake the enchiladas until the cheese is melty and the edges of the tortillas are crisp.
