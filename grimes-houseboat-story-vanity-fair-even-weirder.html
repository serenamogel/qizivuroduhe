The story was later corroborated by her brother when discussing “dumb Claire shit” she used to get into. (Though, he strangely admitted that the houseboat idea was “one of the first adult choices she made.”)</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>Interestingly enough, the houseboat was big enough news that in June 2009, when Grimes was just 21 years old and hadn’t even released her first album yet, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">covered the story</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>My favorite thing a lot of people don’t remember about Grimes was her failed attempt to sail the Mississippi River on this rickety boat. h/t to this 2009 piece from this <a href=#>@StarTribune</a><a href=#>https://t.co/m2htYfaNIF</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kpfywwnSn9</a></p>— Kris Wernowsky (@kriswernowsky) <a href=#>October 4, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>Grimes and her then-boyfriend William Gratz, who were going by the names Zelda Xox and Veruschka — as one does when embarking on a trash houseboat adventure — reportedly packed some live chickens, a sewing machine, and 20 pounds of potatoes into the vessel they christened the “Velvet Glove Cast in Iron.”</p><p>Boucher, who’s from Vancouver, B.C., and Gratz, from Tennessee, met at school in Montreal. The idea for the river journey was hatched last fall. After months of Internet research, they made the 25-hour trip to Bemidji, Minnesota., where a friend allowed them to build the boat on his property. For more than a month, they toiled over the engineering of the 20-foot boat to make sure it floated. They installed accordion folding doors, glass windows, pink shutters, and painted murals in black, white, and red paint of fantastical creatures on the sides. Strangers gave them bikes, a mattress, and the sewing machine (powered by onboard batteries). They got a copy of Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which neither of them had read.</p><p>“I always wanted to live on a boat,” Boucher said. “We both wanted to go south and live on it when we got to New Orleans.”</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>The couple had planned to sail the boat down the Mississippi River from Minneapolis to New Orleans, but unfortunately, they only made it a few miles downstream before the engine crapped out on them. And for the following three weeks, Minneapolis authorities attempted to intervene, before they finally made it to a nearby island and got stuck.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>At that point, the Velvet Glove Cast in Iron was towed off by another boat and was loaded onto a flatbed trailer, taken away, and impounded by the city. The chickens were likewise seized by animal control, and since they couldn’t be reclaimed without a Minneapolis address and permit, they were instead reportedly sent to a chicken farm.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>“I love the idea of the Tom Sawyer adventure,” said Minneapolis park police officer Rob Mooney, who was the first officer to encounter the houseboat and spent weeks chasing the pair around. “The problem is it’s not 1883. You can’t do that anymore. You have to follow the rules.”</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>“I personally allowed them for a couple of weeks to try to solve the problem on their own,” Mooney added. “It was clear that they couldn’t get it done.”</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>In a fitting epilogue to the story, Grimes and Gratz took a city bus to the impound lot to retrieve their belongings from the boat, including a jar of wild rice in order to make dinner for strangers that took them in for a few nights while they planned to continue their journey south by bus.</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=false>It’s unclear if they ever made it to New Orleans that summer, but either way, it clearly made for one heck of a story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8aroKado2K1sMHSnpmomaRiwLW70bJkr5mensG6ecWaoKtllauyr3nWnqCrnJWnfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./arden-rose.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Arden Rose- Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Dating</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./j-d-pardo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>J D Pardo Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelor-in-paradise-aaron-bryant-and-eliza-isichei-break-up-1555224468.html>Bachelor in Paradise Aaron Bryant and Eliza Isichei Break Up</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-baldwin-about-the-author.html>James Baldwin Biography and Quotes | James Baldwin Biography | American Masters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-best-paramore-lyrics-about-self-discovery.html>The best Paramore lyrics about Self-discovery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-rachel-maddow-david-maddow-siblings-find-more-about-the-brother-of-american-television-news-program-host.html>Are Rachel Maddow &amp;amp; David Maddow Siblings?
