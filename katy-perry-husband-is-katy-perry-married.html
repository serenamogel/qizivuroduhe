Unfortunately, the album was commercially unsuccessful. She then moved to Los Angeles at 17 to pursue secular music and later adopted the stage name “Katy Perry” from her mother’s maiden name. She recorded an album under Columbia Records but was eventually dropped before signing with Capitol Records.</p><p>Perry rose to fame with her album One of the Boys (2008), a pop rock record that included her debut single “I Kissed a Girl” and follow-up single “Hot n Cold”. The songs reached number one and three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, respectively. Her disco-influenced pop album Teenage Dream (2010) became a massive success, producing five U.S. number one singles: “California Gurls,” “Teenage Dream,” “Firework,” “E.T.,” and “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.).”</p><p>Perry became the only female singer to achieve this feat. A reissue of the album titled Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection (2012) subsequently produced the U.S. number one single “Part of Me.” Her album Prism (2013) also had two U.S. number one singles: “Roar” and “Dark Horse.” Both of their respective music videos made Perry the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo.</p><p>In 2017, Perry released the electropop album Witness, which featured themes of feminism and a political subtext. Her album Smile (2020) was influenced by her recent motherhood and mental health journey. Perry is also known for her Las Vegas concert residency titled Play (2021-present), which has garnered critical acclaim and commercial success.</p><p>Perry is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold over 143 million records worldwide. All of her studio albums released under Capitol have individually surpassed one billion streams on Spotify, totaling six billion streams.</p><p>She has nine U.S. number one singles, three U.S. number one albums, and has received various accolades, including a Billboard Spotlight Award (currently the only female artist to have one), four Guinness World Records, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award. Perry has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011 to 2019.</p><p>In addition to her music career, <a href=# rel=noopener>Perry</a> has appeared in several movies and TV shows. She released an autobiographical documentary titled Katy Perry: Part of Me in 2012, voiced Smurfette in The Smurfs film series, and launched her own shoe line, Katy Perry Collections, in 2017. Perry also served as a judge on American Idol during its sixteenth season in 2018. She is also the most-followed woman and the third most-followed person on <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter</a>, with over 100 million followers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Katy Perry Husband: Is Katy Perry Married?</h2><p>Katy Perry’s husband is actor Orlando Bloom.
