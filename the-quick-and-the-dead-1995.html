The contestants are paired off, and at the stroke of 12 on the town clock, they stand in the middle of the street and shoot at each other. One must die in order for the other to win. Then it's on to the next round (in this town it's "High Noon" over and over again). The last man standing collects the prize money.</p><p>Herod is always the last man standing. I figured that out because he's still alive. His motives for holding this contest may seem obscure, but actually they are pretty clear; he holds it because it provides a simplistic story structure for the movie, giving it a long series of duels on Main Street as a substitute for any form of genuine dramatic conflict.</p><p>You'd think contestants would have to be pretty hard up to enter a contest where the odds are about 10-to-1 in favor of their being killed. But there's no shortage of entrants, including one guy who adds an ace to his deck every time he kills someone, and another who cuts a scar into his arm after every kill. Also arriving are two strangers: the Kid (<a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>) and Ellen (Sharon Stone). The Kid is cocky and self-confident: "Damn, I'm fast!" he says after polishing off one opponent, and later he asks idly, "Is it possible to improve on perfection?" Ellen is a little harder to read. She is a lone rider who puffs on a thin black cigar and makes a bartender regret it when he assumes she's a hooker. She's sexy in leather pants and a trim outfit (and later manages to find a ballroom gown in her saddlebags). She wants to enter the contest. Hackman, who is attracted to her, doesn't want either Ellen or the Kid to shoot it out, possibly because he suspects that the Kid is his own son.</p><p>Oh, he denies it. But the Kid is adamant. "I'm his son," he declares, "and if this is the only way he's gonna admit that, so be it." In other words (I think), the theory is that if the Kid kills Hackman, by golly, that'll make him admit it.</p><p>The movie's story, as you have grasped, isn't much. But "The Quick and the Dead" is not without its good points. The director is <a href=#>Sam Raimi</a> (the "<a href=#>Evil Dead</a>" movies, "Darkman") and he displays once again his zest for stylistic invention. Early in the movie, a character gets shot through the hat brim, and the sun shines through the hole into the camera lens. A nice touch, but Raimi tops it later in the film by showing the sun shining through a bullet hole clean through a guy's body, and by a third shot in which we look down Main Street through a large hole in a man's head.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55loaq2pLeMmqWdZaSdsm6wxJqbZmlpboI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-angelique-monet-from-dr-phil-kidnapping-and-attempted-murder-case.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Angelique Monet From Dr Phil?
