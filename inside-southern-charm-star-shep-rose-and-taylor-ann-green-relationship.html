Taylor had a pregnancy scare in one of the episodes, so the pair has been having problems. In last week’s episode, she approached Shep and enquired about the state of their relationship. Shep agreed that he was not a “safe bet” when she said she didn’t believe he was ready for a commitment. He closed the talk with Taylor, who seemed irritated, by saying:</p><p>“We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.”</p><p>Meanwhile, reports of trouble in paradise have circulated, but Shep and Taylor have not formally declared their breakup.</p><h2>A Look into Shep and Taylor’s relationship</h2><p>Shep first mentioned Taylor on social media in February 2020, when he tweeted a photo of her with a band’s lead vocalist. The duo’s romance rumors first surfaced in March, then Taylor confirmed her relationship with Shep on Instagram in May 2020.&nbsp;They were shooting Season 7 of Southern Charm throughout the aforementioned months and so had to keep their relationship a secret. During that season, Shep first introduced Taylor to the audience.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Shep-Rose-1.jpeg alt="Shep Rose" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Shep admitted to cheating on Taylor at the Season 7 reunion. Shep explained his interaction with her in the episode:</p><p>“I kissed a girl in a stairway — and that was all there was to it.” It was an old flame, and we were messaging back and forth like, ‘Ooh, tomorrow night,’ but nothing came of it. It was a vulnerable time. I had been drinking. But that’s all it was, and I’ll go to my grave knowing it.”</p><p>The Southern Charm actress went on to say:</p><p>“‘Look, I detest what happened, and it hurt me a lot,’ she says. But I’d prefer to remain with you. I’m madly in love with you. You provide me joy.’ It was a huge thing that we wept.”</p><p>The pair began shooting Season 8 last year and were spotted sharing countless love messages on Instagram. They traveled to Europe in March, and Shep told US Weekly in June, shortly before the Season 8 premiere:</p><p>“We had just recently begun dating, and it was really honeymoon season.” We were just out in the corner doing our own thing and making each other laugh, and now she’s totally on the show and friends — a lot better friends — with everyone, so she really flourishes.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Shep-Rose-1.png alt="Shep Rose" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Shep’s most recent Instagram picture with her was taken on July 10 in Vero Beach, Florida. Taylor’s last post with him was on July 4th from the same place.&nbsp;Meanwhile, in Southern Charm Season 8, the pair will be attempting to figure out the future of their relationship.</p><h2>When will the fifth episode of Southern Charm Season 8 air?</h2><p>In addition to the Taylor-Shep conflict, Southern Charm Season 8 Episode 5 will continue to depict the brawl that erupted at Venita Aspen and Madison LeCroy’s combined birthday celebration. Because the last episode ended on a cliffhanger, the next episode will depict how Venita’s birthday was wrecked. She will attempt to patch things up with Kathryn Dennis and Olivia Flowers, but things will go south. The official description for Southern Charm Season 8 Episode 5 is Exes and Uh Oh’s:</p><p>“Madison and Venita’s combined party goes wrong; Paige establishes ground rules for her relationship with Craig; Shep fights to gain Taylor’s confidence while he’s abroad; Kathryn organizes a ladies’ night out to celebrate her newfound celebrity.”</p><p>Bravo will premiere the new episode on Thursday, July 21, 2022, at 9:00 p.m. ET. Viewers may also watch the program on the network’s website afterward.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigp6uZmbJuv86uq6GdoqN6pLTAq6Rmq6SWv26%2Fx56nZqqfqLJurc2dZK2ZqaG8s3nAp6Vmn6Kasq950Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mason-ramsey-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mason Ramsey Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./enrique-iglesias-ethnicity-what-is-enrique-iglesiass-ethnicity.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Enrique Iglesias Ethnicity, What is Enrique Iglesiass Ethnicity?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelor-in-paradise-aaron-bryant-and-eliza-isichei-break-up-1555224468.html>Bachelor in Paradise Aaron Bryant and Eliza Isichei Break Up</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-baldwin-about-the-author.html>James Baldwin Biography and Quotes | James Baldwin Biography | American Masters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-best-paramore-lyrics-about-self-discovery.html>The best Paramore lyrics about Self-discovery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-rachel-maddow-david-maddow-siblings-find-more-about-the-brother-of-american-television-news-program-host.html>Are Rachel Maddow &amp;amp; David Maddow Siblings?
