This new installment in what could be a continuing Linson semi-franchise—“Art Linson’s Tales of Showbiz”—has a whole hell of a lot going for it in the individual ingredients department. Linson provided the storyline, which no doubt has any number of <i>a clef</i> elements. The co-screenwriters include <a href=#>Jeffrey Ross</a>, the comedian and Friar’s Club figurehead who knows where dozens of bodies are buried, the great Richard LaGravenese, and <a href=#>Lewis Friedman</a>, a veteran showbiz gagman and another repository of outrageous tales. Hackford has more than a few first-rate pictures under his belt, including 2004’s “<a href=#>Ray</a>” and the underseen “Blood In, Blood Out.” And the cast is spectacular, by 1980 standards and by those of 2016. Robert De Niro, <a href=#>Danny DeVito</a>, <a href=#>Harvey Keitel</a> (reuniting with De Niro for the first time since, um, “Little Fockers” in 2010 if I’m not mistaken), <a href=#>Charles Grodin</a>, <a href=#>Patti Lupone</a>, <a href=#>Cloris Leachman</a> and more, with <a href=#>Edie Falco</a> and <a href=#>Leslie Mann</a> playing the teen roles, relatively speaking. And two raft loads of cameos from real-life comedy legends as themselves.</p><p>But the movie never builds enough momentum, emotional or narrative, to get the viewer on its side. De Niro plays Jackie Burke, an aging comic at a career impasse. Like so many movies with aging casts, this one makes a lot of hay out of seniors trying to cope with the digital world. Jackie doesn’t do such a good job of coping when, one night at a sparsely attended gig, he discovers that a couple of hecklers are razzing him not just for the hell of it, but to provide fodder for their YouTube (or something) series. Jackie head-butts the guy in indignation and winds up battling an assault charge. During his community service (the battle didn’t go his way; he also ended up doing thirty days) he finds himself serving at a food kitchen alongside Mann’s Harmony, the troubled daughter of a one-time mobster played by Keitel. The two strike up a friendship that one desperately hopes does not blossom into a romance, while Jackie juggles money troubles, opportunities for gigs, and other challenges in a way that suggest that he thrives on self-defeat in a sense.</p><p>One of the movie’s problems is that it really doesn’t make clear the particulars of Jackie’s situation early on. We know that he had once acted the role of “<a href=#>Eddie</a>” in a popular television sitcom, and that the quasi-“Honeymooners” show made his name, his fandom, and whatever’s left of his fortune. But his existential/artistic quandary only becomes clear as the movie continues. By the time we seem Mann’s character looking at a vintage vinyl LP titled “The Mind of Jackie Burke” do we understand that Jackie, more than being just a comic who worked blue but got a family television show anyway (think <a href=#>Bob Saget</a>) was not just a shock comic but a social commentator (think <a href=#>George Carlin</a> or even Lenny Bruce). Hackford gives us a lot of nice character notes for Jackie (I particularly liked the scene where he’s ironing his own clothes while listening to a very obscure Art Blakey LP), but saving this context for last leaves the character, and some of his decisions, a little murky.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lk6S6prDImqVmamBmhA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./iggy-azalea.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Iggy Azalea Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Husband, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./september-dangelo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>September D'Angelo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelor-in-paradise-aaron-bryant-and-eliza-isichei-break-up-1555224468.html>Bachelor in Paradise Aaron Bryant and Eliza Isichei Break Up</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-baldwin-about-the-author.html>James Baldwin Biography and Quotes | James Baldwin Biography | American Masters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-best-paramore-lyrics-about-self-discovery.html>The best Paramore lyrics about Self-discovery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-rachel-maddow-david-maddow-siblings-find-more-about-the-brother-of-american-television-news-program-host.html>Are Rachel Maddow &amp;amp; David Maddow Siblings?
