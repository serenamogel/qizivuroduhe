Well, we gotcha covered with this list of the best things to eat with salsa besides chips. Hopefully, you have one of these items (or something similar) lying around and you can finish up your salsa ASAP so that next week you can buy both and your chip and salsa cycles can get back in sync.</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>El Monterey Extra Crunchy Southwest Chicken Taquitos</strong></a><p>I mean, this one makes sense. When wondering what to eat with salsa, going with what is essentially a nacho roll-up seems like a solid move. Plus, these taquitos are out of this world. They are so good, in fact, that they elicited an unprompted “holy s***” from managing editor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwynedd Stuart</a> when she first tasted them. They are chock full of chicken, cheese, peppers, and beans all rolled in a tube and fried, and we are here for it—so is that half tub of salsa in your fridge.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Frozen Taquitos: Our Updated Ranking</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Snyder’s of Hanover Snaps</strong></a><p>I know, what?!? One of your best things to eat with salsa is pretzels?!? Hear me out. If you have no chips on hand and pretzels are the only salty thing you have around, they will in fact work in a pinch and be actually good with salsa. These pretzels are especially good for the job because their lattice shape means they can actually hold some salsa, provided the salsa is chunky enough (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we recommend Casa Sanchez</a>). Sporked contributor Danny Palumbo pointed out that these pretzels have a “buttery, salty, lightly toasted feel to them,” and if you don’t want that with salsa, that’s fine. More for me.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Pretzels: An Updated Ranking!</a></strong></p><p>I mean…we already put marinara on these bad boys—imagine a tangy, salty, spicy alternative. Enter mozz sticks and salsa. The ooey-gooey mozzarella with the flavorful onion-y, garlick-y salsa? Plus, TGI Fridays mozzarella sticks were by far the best mozz sticks we tried in our mozzarella stick taste test, thanks to their “good flavor, great quality cheese, and a crispy, crunchy panko breading.” MmmmMmmmMMMM. Now I am craving mozzarella sticks and salsa and don’t know what to do with myself. Don’t be like me, just get some mozzarella sticks and try this.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The 5 Best Frozen Mozzarella Sticks for at-Home Apps</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Crunchmaster Multi-Grain 6-Seed Crackers</strong></a><p>Aside from being my nickname in high school (anyone else known for eating carrots in class? no? just me?), Crunchmaster is also a brand that makes multi-grain crackers that are “crispy and crunchy and seedy and salty.” They have a crunch to them that Danny could only describe as “masterful.” If you are wondering what to eat with salsa, I say anything with a “masterful” crunch probably has a good chance of being pretty darn good. Dip these in your salsa and let me know how it is! (Spoiler alert: I bet it’s great).</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Crackers: The 7 Saltiest, Tastiest, Best Crackers</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Fast Fixin’ Chicken Breast Nuggets</strong></a><p>At this point, you may be thinking to yourself, “Dang, I was asking the wrong question!” It’s not, “What to eat with salsa?” It’s, “Is there anything on Earth that doesn’t go well with salsa?” And the answer is no, everything goes well with salsa. And that brings us to chicken nuggets. Dip ‘em in your salsas, people. Now, granted, these particular chicky nuggs don’t need any salsa. Senior writer Jordan Myrick said, and I quote, “These are one of the few brands of nuggets I’ve ever eaten that, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, might not…need…sauce.” But if we’ve learned anything from Pixar movies, it’s that need and want are two different things and while we may not NEED salsa on these nuggs, a little salsa would almost certainly enhance the experience.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Frozen Chicken Nuggets That Are as Good as Fast Food</a></strong></p><p>Lastly, Triscuits. Still wondering what to eat with salsa? Look no further. Triscuits are neat in that they are far from the texture and taste of a tortilla chip but the salt level is 100% there. These are some oily, salty, wheaty flakey square crackers, and, as Danny said, it’s “hard to beat their coarse texture and unique bite.” But you can beat it. How? By dipping the darn things in salsa and eating them. Just trust me. Have I ever steered you wrong? (And if I have, have you forgiven me yet?).</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Crackers: The 7 Saltiest, Tastiest, Best Crackers</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFuwM5mnJqsXay2tbSMrJilq5Fk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./captive-season-1-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Captive Season 1 Review</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sara-velez-galeano-bio-family-career-married-net-worth-height.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sara Velez Galeano Bio, Family, Career, Married, Net Worth, Height</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelor-in-paradise-aaron-bryant-and-eliza-isichei-break-up-1555224468.html>Bachelor in Paradise Aaron Bryant and Eliza Isichei Break Up</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-baldwin-about-the-author.html>James Baldwin Biography and Quotes | James Baldwin Biography | American Masters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-best-paramore-lyrics-about-self-discovery.html>The best Paramore lyrics about Self-discovery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-rachel-maddow-david-maddow-siblings-find-more-about-the-brother-of-american-television-news-program-host.html>Are Rachel Maddow &amp;amp; David Maddow Siblings?
