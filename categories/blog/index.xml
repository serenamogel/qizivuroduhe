I have a sneaking suspicion that if Bogdanovich could somehow magically go back in time and redo the film, he might recast this role.</description></item><item><title>See Jake Gyllenhaals New Bald Look</title><link>/jake-gyllenhaal-bald-html.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/jake-gyllenhaal-bald-html.html</guid><description>Sorry to startle so late in the day, but Jake went full Willis for his new movie End of Watch.
