And that’s exactly what happened.</p><p>The self-proclaimed soup enthusiast from Bushwick first heard about the communal stew nights in Fermi Playground from a friend who saw a post about the open invite online.</p><p>Although it might sound like a gross new Gen Z trend — it’s actually historic. Some legendary “medieval” broths have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cooked for more than 300 years</a>, according to food historian Reay Tannahill, author of the culinary classic <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>“Food in History.”</a></p><p>Fast-forward to last month: Annie Rauwerda,<strong> </strong>24, who runs the popular account Depths of Wikipedia <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">across </a><a href=#>multiple </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">platforms</a>, posted&nbsp;a series of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">now-viral videos</a>&nbsp;deeming this sweaty season “perpetual stew summer.”</p><p>One clip features the meal’s Wikipedia entry, which explains that “perpetual stew, also known as&nbsp;forever soup,&nbsp;hunter’s pot or&nbsp;hunter’s stew, is a pot into which whatever foodstuffs one can find is placed and cooked.”</p><p>And then comes the historic, albeit slightly stomach-churning reality: “The pot is never or rarely emptied all the way, and ingredients and liquid are replenished as necessary. Such foods can continue cooking for decades or longer, if properly maintained.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Annie Rauwerda posted&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a now-viral TikTok video</a>&nbsp;deeming this season “perpetual stew summer” as she began simmering her concoction on June 7. But she’s not the first: A family in Bangkok has been cooking <a href=#>soup from the same broth for over 50 years</a> — and food historians have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">documented a pot-au-feu</a> in Normandy that’s stewed for some 300 years. <span class=credit>Stefano Giovannini for N.Y.Post</span></figure><figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright" readability=1.5><p>‘This perpetual stew … reminded us of how great it is to be around a sense of a loving community.&nbsp;It was a true New York experience.’</p>Garrett Zelada, 33, X-ray tech visiting from San Jose, California</figure><p>Rauwerda began simmering potato leek in her Crockpot on June 7. She told The Post she planned to keep it cooking for at least five days — and <a href=#>now it’s been over a month</a>.</p><p>After initially inviting some friends over to add to the stew, which was documented in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a TikTok video</a> that has now amassed over 2 million views, Rauwerda put out a call for prospective “stew-friends” near Bushwick to join the stew crew.</p><p>Her first public event at Fermi saw about 50 attendees, among whom it was generally agreed upon that the gathering and grub were equally “stewper-duper.” &nbsp;</p><p>The stews have carried on for several weeks now, with people gathering in the Brooklyn park to add their vegan ingredients to the cauldron and join the “stew-mmunity,” including Gerber, who has now attended four stew nights.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">She posted flyers around Bushwick and put out calls online inviting anyone and everyone to come bring a vegan ingredient and sip on the stew in Fermi Playground in Brooklyn. <span class=credit>Stefano Giovannini for N.Y.Post</span></figure><p>“Everyone comes with a shared curiosity and mild amusement, with the intention of getting to know the other people who come,” Gerber said.</p><p>“The technique of making the stew seems almost symbolic of the community it creates — everyone contributing to the meal turns the entire night into a communal, shared experience with a heightened sense of community,” the fan continued. “We’re all a part of creating this bizarre, and surprisingly delicious, thing together.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Joanna Gerber, 23, loves the “shared curiosity and mild amusement” that everyone brings to the event. She’s attended four stew nights so far. <span class=credit>Stefano Giovannini for N.Y.Post</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">All that Rauwerda asks of her “stew-mmunity” is to bring a non-meat ingredient to add into the stew every week. <span class=credit>Stefano Giovannini for N.Y.Post</span></figure><p>Rauwerda shares daily updates of the stew, info on the next meet-ups (7 p.m. on Tuesday, July 18) and frequently asked questions, including how to RSVP, on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an official website</a>.</p><p>She’s shared that some stews have tasted better than others (check out the June 18 update highlighting Gerber’s spice mix) depending on what ingredients her “stew-dents” bring — but she makes sure to keep the concoction simmering at 200 degrees Fahrenheit (she connects to a generator while at the park) for flavor and food safety reasons.</p><p>Perpetual stews are commonly associated with medieval inns. However, the concept has stood the test of time and traveled all around the world.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The stew is kept at 200 degrees Fahrenheit and nearly finished every week. A small batch of mostly broth is left behind to continue cooking and flavor the next meal. <span class=credit>Stefano Giovannini for N.Y.Post</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">This round of the soup has been simmering for 36 days. Rauwerda hasn’t announced how long she plans to continue cooking, but her meet-ups have become more popular every week. <span class=credit>Stefano Giovannini for N.Y.Post</span></figure><p>A family in Bangkok has been cooking <a href=#>soup from the same broth for over 50 years</a> now, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">coverage from 1981</a>&nbsp;detailed a French beef stew that had then been cooking for 21 years.</p><p>Historians have also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">documented a pot-au-feu</a> in Normandy that has reportedly been burning for 300 years, and another one in Perpignan that began in the 1400s but didn’t survive World War II.</p><p>Food writer Arthur Prager recommended refrigerating the soup overnight if unfinished, then skimming the fat off the top — where bacteria tend to build up — and simmering for at least 20 minutes before serving again.</p><p>While leftover veggies and meat are discarded after two rounds of reheating, the broth, Prager said, “will never spoil.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Elaina Giannetti, 23, attended the event “that was a bit out of the ordinary” after her friend who lives in Colorado begged her to go and report back to him. <span class=credit>Stefano Giovannini for N.Y.Post</span></figure><p>However, like Rauwerda’s, the pots are typically nearly depleted by the end of a meal, leaving behind only broth that will be used to start and flavor the next batch — one that Elaina Giannetti, 23, plans to taste.</p><p>The virology researcher&nbsp;living on the Lower East Side traveled across the bridge last week to sip on some stew after her friend who lives in Colorado begged her to go in his place. She plans to return.</p><p>“It felt like a group of genuine people who wanted to do something together that was a bit out of the ordinary,” she told The Post.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Garrett Zelada, 33, and his fiancée, Nafisa Kahn, 27, sipped on some stew after reading about the event online while searching for something to do when their flight back to California was canceled. <span class=credit>Stefano Giovannini for N.Y.Post</span></figure><p>Garrett Zelada, 33, was a part of that group.
