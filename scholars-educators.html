She translated an article on an invention by Charles Babbage, and added her own comments. Because she introduced many computer concepts, Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer. She died on November 27, 1852.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ada Lovelace, born as Augusta Ada Byron on December 10, 1815, was the only legitimate child of the famous poet <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/lord-byron data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lord George Gordon Byron" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lord George Gordon Byron</a>. Lord Byron's marriage to Lovelace's mother, Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke Byron, was not a happy one. Lady Byron separated from her husband only weeks after their daughter was born. A few months later, Lord Byron left England, and Lovelace never saw her father again. He died in Greece when Ada was 8 years old.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lovelace had an unusual upbringing for an aristocratic girl in the mid-1800s. At her mother's insistence, tutors taught her mathematics and science. Such challenging subjects were not standard fare for women at the time, but her mother believed that engaging in rigorous studies would prevent Lovelace from developing her father's moody and unpredictable temperament. Lovelace was also forced to lie still for extended periods of time because her mother believed it would help her develop self-control.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">From early on, Lovelace showed a talent for numbers and language. She received instruction from William Frend, a social reformer; William King, the family's doctor; and Mary Somerville, a Scottish astronomer and mathematician. Somerville was one of the first women to be admitted into the Royal Astronomical Society.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Babbage and the Analytical Engine</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around the age of 17, Ada met Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor. The pair became friends, and the much older Babbage served as a mentor to Lovelace. Through Babbage, Lovelace began studying advanced mathematics with University of London professor Augustus de Morgan.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lovelace was fascinated by Babbage's ideas. Known as the father of the computer, he invented the difference engine, which was meant to perform mathematical calculations. Lovelace got a chance to look at the machine before it was finished, and was captivated by it. Babbage also created plans for another device known as the analytical engine, designed to handle more complex calculations.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lovelace was later asked to translate an article on Babbage's analytical engine that had been written by Italian engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea for a Swiss journal. She not only translated the original French text into English but also added her own thoughts and ideas on the machine. Her notes ended up being three times longer than the original article. Her work was published in 1843, in an English science journal. Lovelace used only the initials "A.A.L.," for Augusta Ada Lovelace, in the publication.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In her notes, Lovelace described how codes could be created for the device to handle letters and symbols along with numbers. She also theorized a method for the engine to repeat a series of instructions, a process known as looping that computer programs use today. Lovelace also offered up other forward-thinking concepts in the article. For her work, Lovelace is often considered to be the first computer programmer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lovelace's article attracted little attention when she was alive. In her later years, she tried to develop mathematical schemes for winning at gambling. Unfortunately, her schemes failed and put her in financial peril. Lovelace died from uterine cancer in London on November 27, 1852. She was buried next to her father, in the graveyard of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, England.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1835, Lovelace married William King, who became the Earl of Lovelace three years later. She then took the title of Countess of Lovelace. They shared a love of horses and had three children together. From most accounts, he supported his wife's academic endeavors. Lovelace and her husband socialized with many of the interesting minds of the times, including scientist Michael Faraday and writer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/charles-dickens data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Charles Dickens" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Charles Dickens</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lovelace's health suffered, however, after a bout of cholera in 1837. She had lingering problems with asthma and her digestive system. Doctors gave her painkillers, such as laudanum and opium, and her personality began to change. She reportedly experienced mood swings and hallucinations.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lovelace's contributions to the field of computer science were not discovered until the 1950s. Her notes were reintroduced to the world by B.V. Bowden, who republished them in Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines in 1953. Since then, Ada has received many posthumous honors for her work. In 1980, the U.S. Department of Defense named a newly developed computer language "Ada," after Lovelace.</p><ul data-node-id=21 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Augusta Ada Byron King</li><li>Birth Year: 1815</li><li>Birth date: December 10, 1815</li><li>Birth City: London</li><li>Birth Country: United Kingdom</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: English mathematician Ada Lovelace, the daughter of poet Lord Byron, has been called "the first computer programmer" for writing an algorithm for a computing machine in the mid-1800s.</li><li>Astrological Sign: Sagittarius</li><li>Death Year: 1852</li><li>Death date: November 27, 1852</li><li>Death City: London</li><li>Death Country: United Kingdom</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=26 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Ada Lovelace Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/scholars-educators/ada-lovelace</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: May 6, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiqnKCfoa6zv4yem66bkam8s7%2BOmpuaZZykw6a4wJyc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./car-racer-brad-wildes-obituary-death-cancer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Car Racer Brad Wildes Obituary And Death: Cancer Update</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mario-van-peebles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mario Van Peebles movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelor-in-paradise-aaron-bryant-and-eliza-isichei-break-up-1555224468.html>Bachelor in Paradise Aaron Bryant and Eliza Isichei Break Up</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-baldwin-about-the-author.html>James Baldwin Biography and Quotes | James Baldwin Biography | American Masters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-best-paramore-lyrics-about-self-discovery.html>The best Paramore lyrics about Self-discovery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-rachel-maddow-david-maddow-siblings-find-more-about-the-brother-of-american-television-news-program-host.html>Are Rachel Maddow &amp;amp; David Maddow Siblings?
