But once I caught wind of the premise of “The&nbsp;Beguiled”—females in various states of arousal and jealousy over the presence of the handsome male prisoner in their midst—me and my incubating libido couldn’t stop watching.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Years had gone by since I thought about my first and only encounter with this overheated if highly watchable potboiler.&nbsp;But the arrival of a new “Beguiled” gave me permission to revisit it on DVD. Surprisingly, I found myself riveted by the opening credits, which I am sure I missed the first go-round: sepia-toned photos of soldiers in violent combat are shown while a military drumbeat&nbsp;is heard on the soundtrack. Those images dissolve and we see a barefoot young girl (Pamelyn Ferdin, a ubiquitous child actress at that time) with a basket slung on her arm, looking for all the world like Little Red Riding Hood as she plucks mushrooms along the way through the forest. Her Big Bad Wolf shows up soon enough in the form of Eastwood’s Union soldier, swooning from loss of blood. We learn he is Corp. John McBurney. He asks his savior, Amy, how old she is. “Twelve. Thirteen in September.” Replies McBurney, “Old enough for kisses,” and he helps himself to her lips.</p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/59504280297ed37131000036/The_Beguiled_1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Whoa, I did not see that coming. Needless to say, such underage liberties do not exist in Coppola’s opening scene, where <a href=#>Colin Farrell</a>’s McBurney bonds with <a href=#>Oona Laurence</a>’s Amy—whose brother died in battle—in a more sibling-like fashion. He isn’t initially in the same league as Eastwood’s wounded warrior when it comes to being a master manipulator, either. It takes him time to figure out each female’s soft spot to guarantee his safety and usefulness.</p><p>But what the 1971 intro establishes—partly thanks to the jittery rat-tat-tats provided by <a href=#>Lalo Schifrin</a> (creator of the “<a href=#>Mission: Impossible</a>” theme) and the gun-powder-hazy visuals amid Spanish moss by ace cinematographer <a href=#>Bruce Surtees</a>—is a world in chaos, where normal societal rules don’t necessarily apply. With cannon fire within earshot, the girls go through the motions of learning French and proper manners. When Amy finally drags the half-dead McBurney to the school, one of the older students fears the enemy soldier might “rape every one of us.”&nbsp;That threat will be alluded to again in the form of other potential male attackers who pass by outside the school’s gates and come knocking on the door in the dark. Meanwhile, spinsterish head mistress Martha (<a href=#>Geraldine Page</a>) is heard thinking as she gazes upon the wounded man, “If this war goes on much longer, I’ll forget I was a woman.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmn52RqcKzsdJomGaqlanCs7rIp55mrpmotrW70WaaqKWglr%2BqusZmq6GdXanEsHnVnqmsoZ%2BjwG67xWaroZ1dl7KowcilnJ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./king-von-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>King Von Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./unpredictable-family-korean-drama-cast-name.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Unpredictable Family Korean Drama Cast Name &amp;amp; Photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelor-in-paradise-aaron-bryant-and-eliza-isichei-break-up-1555224468.html>Bachelor in Paradise Aaron Bryant and Eliza Isichei Break Up</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-baldwin-about-the-author.html>James Baldwin Biography and Quotes | James Baldwin Biography | American Masters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-best-paramore-lyrics-about-self-discovery.html>The best Paramore lyrics about Self-discovery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-rachel-maddow-david-maddow-siblings-find-more-about-the-brother-of-american-television-news-program-host.html>Are Rachel Maddow &amp;amp; David Maddow Siblings?
