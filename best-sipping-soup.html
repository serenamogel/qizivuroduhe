Would I hook myself up to an IV bag full of nutrients if it meant I got to maximize my time? Possibly. Would I miss the delicious foods I’d otherwise be enjoying? Without a doubt. Thankfully, soup comes comes in clutch with its beautiful blend of convenience and great flavor. It’s the perfect food for eating on the go. You can sip it out of pretty much any vessel (embarrassingly, I’m a fan of sipping soup out of a shaker bottle), and sometimes you even get chunks to chew on so you can feel like you’re eating an actual meal. If you’re looking for the best sipping soup to drink on the go, I’ve got just the list for you.</p><strong>Campbell’s Well Yes! Roasted Red Pepper & Tomato Sipping Soup</strong><p>We can put the shaker bottle away because Campbell’s had on-the-go soup drinkers in mind when they made this Well Yes! Roasted Red Pepper & Tomato Sipping Soup, which comes in its own little sippy cup. Please do not ask me what the “Well Yes!” is referring to because I simply do not know the answer to that question. I do, however, know that Campbell’s has been able to maximize the flavors you can enjoy on the go with this concoction. It’s a beefed-up <a href=#>tomato soup</a> that just needs to be microwaved to be enjoyed—it doesn’t get much easier than that!</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best tomato soup</a></strong></p><strong>Kettle & Fire Butternut Squash Soup With Chicken Bone Broth</strong><p>A lot of <a href=#>butternut squash soup</a> is super thick and gloopy, kind of like baby food, but my favorite thing about Kettle & Fire butternut squash soup is that it’s nice and thin, making it one of the best sipping soups at the grocery store. I feel so defeated when I’m trying to drink my lunch and I just can’t get it all down. It makes me miss having a spoon—sorry, thick soups! This is a savory and nutritious solution and it’s one of the best soups to drink on the go, especially when the weather starts to cool and you’re craving fall flavors.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best butternut squash soup</a></strong></p><strong>Campbell’s Chicken & Stars</strong><p>Campbell’s chicken noodle soup is iconic (and one of the <a href=#>best chicken noodle soups</a>, according to the Sporked crew), but since we’re looking for the best sipping soup, we’re trading noodles for stars in this case. Campbell’s Chicken & Stars soup tastes the same as the comforting, nostalgic condensed chicken soup you know and love, but the little pasta stars are just so nice and easy to slurp. A thermos full of this is pure comfort, even when you’re going 70 mph down the highway.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best chicken noodle soup</a></strong></p><strong>Andersen’s Creamy Soup Split Pea</strong><p>Andersen’s Creamy Split Pea Soup is a revelation. Sporked managing editor <a href=#>Gwynedd Stuart</a> told me that she’s purchased and eaten it multiple times since the team did their <a href=#>split pea soup</a> taste test. It also happens to be an ideal sipping soup. See, most other split pea soups actually contain bits of peas, along with other vegetables and sometimes even bits of ham. Not Andersen’s. It’s so creamy and dreamy. It tastes slow cooked and delicious. If you’re eating this soup at home (i.e. out of a bowl with a spoon), you should absolutely top it with <a href=#>shredded cheddar</a> and diced onion, but it’s also excellent all on its own, sipped right out of a mug.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best split pea soup</a></strong></p><strong>Epic Bone Broth Tuscan Chicken</strong><p>If you don’t have time to eat food, it can be pretty hard to get all the protein you need to get through the day. That’s where Epic Bone Broth comes in. It’s easy to drink—a perfect sipping soup—and it has 12 grams of protein in a serving. Oh and did we mention it tastes really good? It’s meaty, flavorful, savory, and easy to enjoy. I guess you might want to avoid it right before the gym so you don’t get the meat sweats, but it’s still a great way to sip the protein you need for a busy day. Can you get meat sweats from a bone broth? I’m not trying to find out.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best bone broth</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuv8ipp6Kml2LAsMHPaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-mute-words-on-twitter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here's How to Mute Words and Phrases on Twitter so You Can Try to Avoid Spoilers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./veronica-tejera-net-worth-before-arrest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Veronica Tejera Net Worth Before Arrest: Where Is she?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelor-in-paradise-aaron-bryant-and-eliza-isichei-break-up-1555224468.html>Bachelor in Paradise Aaron Bryant and Eliza Isichei Break Up</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-baldwin-about-the-author.html>James Baldwin Biography and Quotes | James Baldwin Biography | American Masters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-best-paramore-lyrics-about-self-discovery.html>The best Paramore lyrics about Self-discovery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-rachel-maddow-david-maddow-siblings-find-more-about-the-brother-of-american-television-news-program-host.html>Are Rachel Maddow &amp;amp; David Maddow Siblings?
