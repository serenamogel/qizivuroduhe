Despite being just a teenager, she was ready to make sacrifices and have her baby.</span></p><p><span>Two months before her due date, she became friends with another teenager named Kassandra Toruga. Toruga also claimed she was pregnant at the same time. She even showed ultrasound pictures of her baby to Angelique.&nbsp;</span></p>@angeliquemonet0 Reply to @oteromommyof4 ♬ original sound – Angelique Cruz?<p><span>Shortly after, the two soon-to-be mothers bonded over their teen motherhood experiences. As so Monet had thought!</span></p><p><span>During the last trimester of her pregnancy, Angelique realized that Kassandra was trying to steal her baby. A year after the arrest, the latter even admitted to planning on doing the unthinkable.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=angelique-monet-story-horror-of-kidnapping-and-attempted-murder><span class=ez-toc-section id=angelique-monet-story-horror-of-kidnapping-and-attempted-murder></span>Angelique Monet Story: Horror of Kidnapping And Attempted Murder<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>On Feb 16, 2011, Angelique and Kassandra were hanging out at the former’s house. After some time, Monet smelled smoke and realized her closet had caught fire.</span></p><p><span>But, as her motherly instinct kicked in, she figured out this was more than just a fire. Eventually, she called 911 for the investigation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When the emergency team arrived, they not only put out the fire but also found something disturbing in Kassandra’s bag. When they did further digging, they retrieved pair of scissors and two big butcher knives from the bag.</span></p><p><span>When the police questioned Toruga about the items, she confessed that she wanted to cut Angelique. She planned to kidnap Monet’s baby and later call the baby her own. The reports even revealed that wasn’t even pregnant at all.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Consequently, Kassandra was sentenced to seven and half years in prison for the attempted murder and kidnapping of Angelique Monet and her baby. Toruga supposedly also had a history of schizophrenia.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, the incident scarred Monet throughout her life.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=where-is-angelique-now><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-angelique-now></span>Where is Angelique now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Despite all the events, Angelique gave birth to her baby son named Ryland. Ryland is healthy and doing great right now.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Likewise, Angelique is trying to move on these days. She has even started a family of her own with four children. Nonetheless, this took years of counseling and therapy.</span></p><p><span>She is very active on Tiktok under the user name @angeliquemonet0. She uses her platform to speak about her story and has amassed a good fan following of over 151.9 thousand followers.</span></p>@angeliquemonet0 That pre k drama tho ? #momsoftiktok#momtok#bestie#preschool ♬ original sound – prettyenergy<p><span>In her videos, Monet revealed that she is happily married and even working as a nurse.
