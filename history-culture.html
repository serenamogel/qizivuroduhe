Little is known about his early life. In 1614, he was kidnapped by English explorer Thomas Hunt, who brought him to Spain where he was sold into slavery. Squanto escaped, eventually returning to North America in 1619. He then returned to the Patuxet region, where he became an interpreter and guide for the Pilgrim settlers at Plymouth in the 1620s. He died circa November 1622 in Chatham, Massachusetts.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Capture</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born circa 1580 near Plymouth, Massachusetts, Squanto, also known as Tisquantum, is best remembered for serving as an interpreter and guide for the Pilgrim settlers at Plymouth in the 1620s. Historians know little about Squanto's life. A Patuxet Indian born in present-day Massachusetts, Squanto is believed to have been captured as a young man along the Maine coast in 1605 by Captain George Weymouth, who had been commissioned by Plymouth Company owner Sir Ferdinando Gorges to explore the coast of Maine and Massachusetts, and reportedly captured Squanto, along with four Penobscots, because he thought his financial backers in Britain might want to see some Indians.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Weymouth brought Squanto and the other Indians to England, where Squanto lived with Ferdinando Gorges, who taught him English and hired him to be an interpreter and guide.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Interpreter and Guide for the Pilgrims</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Now fluent in English, Squanto returned to his homeland in 1614 with English explorer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/john-smith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Smith" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John Smith</a>, possibly acting as a guide, but was captured again by another British explorer, Thomas Hunt, and sold into slavery in Spain. Squanto escaped, lived with monks for a few years, and eventually returned to North America in 1619, only to find his entire Patuxet tribe dead from smallpox. He went to live with the nearby Wampanoags.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1621, Squanto was introduced to the Pilgrims at Plymouth, and subsequently acted as an interpreter between Pilgrim representatives and Wampanoag Chief Massasoit. In the fall of 1621, the Pilgrims and Wampanoags celebrated the first Thanksgiving after reaping a successful crop. The following year, Squanto deepened the Pilgrims' trust by helping them find a lost boy, and assisted them with planting and fishing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Squanto's unique knowledge of the English language and English ways gave him power. He sought to increase his status among other native groups by exaggerating his influence with the colonists and even going so far as to tell them that if they didn't do what he wanted, he could have the English release the plague, which he claimed they were holding in storage pits.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Embroiled in the politics emerging between the settlers and the local tribes, Squanto died of a fever in Chatham, Massachusetts, circa November 1622, while acting as a guide for Governor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/william-bradford data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="William Bradford." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">William Bradford.</a></p><ul data-node-id=16 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 1580</li><li>Birth State: Massachusetts</li><li>Birth City: Near Plymouth (present-day Massachusetts)</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Squanto, also known as Tisquantum, was a Native American of the Patuxet tribe who acted as an interpreter and guide to the Pilgrim settlers at Plymouth during their first winter in the New World.</li><li>Death Year: 1622</li><li>Death State: Massachusetts</li><li>Death City: Chatham (present-day Massachusetts)</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=19><ul data-node-id=21 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Squanto Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/history-culture/squanto</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: July 9, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGifoqukpL%2B6ecKuo62topp8tL3UmqWtpw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./folding-at-home-reaches-exascale-1000000000000000000-operations-per-second-for-covid-19.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>1,500,000,000,000,000,000 Operations Per Second for COVID-19</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mtn-dew-purple-thunder-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Mtn Dew Purple Thunder: Our Honest Review</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelor-in-paradise-aaron-bryant-and-eliza-isichei-break-up-1555224468.html>Bachelor in Paradise Aaron Bryant and Eliza Isichei Break Up</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-baldwin-about-the-author.html>James Baldwin Biography and Quotes | James Baldwin Biography | American Masters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-best-paramore-lyrics-about-self-discovery.html>The best Paramore lyrics about Self-discovery</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-rachel-maddow-david-maddow-siblings-find-more-about-the-brother-of-american-television-news-program-host.html>Are Rachel Maddow &amp;amp; David Maddow Siblings?
