Before we answer that, let’s examine Ty’s biography to discover who would make his perfect match.</p><h3 id=h-ty-s-backstory data-injectable=false>Ty’s Backstory</h3><p data-characters=713 data-current-count=852 data-injectable=true>Ty was born Gary Tygert Burton in Atlanta, Georgia. His mother Yvonne Vickery raised him and his brother as a single mother until remarrying. Ty was then adopted by his mother’s new husband taking on the new last name Pennington. He originally attended Kennesaw State University but transferred to Art Institute of Atlanta where he received his Bachelor of Arts in graphic design.
