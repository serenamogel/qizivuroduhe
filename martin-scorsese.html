Scorsese’s passion for movies date back to his childhood.

Raised by Italian American parents in the Little Italy district of Manhattan, Scorsese later remembered the area as being <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/new-york-interviews-plays-films/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“like a village in Sicily.”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">“like a village in Sicily.”</a> Scorsese’s parents, Charles and Catherine, both worked part-time as actors, helping set the stage for their son’s love of cinema.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Because Scorsese was afflicted by severe asthma, his childhood activities were limited; rather than play sports, he spent much of his time in front of the television or at the movie theater, where he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.film-foundation.org/schoonmaker-scorsese-on-powell-and-pressburgers-tales-of-hoffmann data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fell in love" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">fell in love</a> especially with stories about the Italian experience and films by directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.

Although his parents “didn’t get” his mania for movies, Scorsese felt he was headed in the right direction when a 10-minute comedy short earned him a $500 scholarship to New York University.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 title="Early Career: NYU Instructor and Mean Streets" data-anchor-id=early-career-nyu-instructor-and-mean-streets class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Career: NYU Instructor and Mean Streets</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Scorsese completed his master’s in fine arts, with an emphasis in film directing, at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. He made several films during his time there and briefly worked at the university as a film instructor after his graduation. His students included Jonathan Kaplan and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/oliver-stone data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Oliver Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Oliver Stone</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1968, Scorsese completed his first feature-length film, Who’s That Knocking at My Door? While working on that project, he met Harvey Keitel, whom he would go on to cast in many future projects, as well as Thelma Schoonmaker, an editor with whom he would collaborate for more than 50 years. Scorsese earned an early fan in film critic <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/roger-ebert data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Roger Ebert" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Roger Ebert</a>, who <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-call-first--whos-that-knocking-at-my-door-1967 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="called Scorsese’s films" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">called Scorsese’s films</a> from this time “artistically satisfying and technically comparable to the best films being made anywhere.”</p><img alt="a black and white photo of martin scorsese directing cesare danova and harvey keitel on the set of the film mean streets" title="Cesare Danova, Harvy Keitel, and Martin Scorsese during filming of ‘Mean Streets’" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/martin-scorsese-directs-cesare-danova-and-harvey-keitel-news-photo-1693323627.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Martin Scorsese (right) directs Cesare Danova and Harvey Keitel during the filming of Mean Streets.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Mean Streets, released in 1973 a month before his 31st birthday, was Scorsese’s first film to be widely acknowledged as a masterpiece. Revisiting characters from Who’s That Knocking at My Door?, the movie showcased elements that have since become trademarks of Scorsese’s filmmaking: dark themes, unsympathetic lead characters, religion, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/gangsters data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Mafia" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">the Mafia</a>, unusual camera techniques, and contemporary music.

His 1976 film Taxi Driver starred De Niro as a mentally unstable cab driver and Vietnam veteran who is pushed to violence by his disgust with the crime and decay of New York City. Widely considered a masterpiece, Taxi Driver helped define his gritty filmmaking style and complex camera movements, and it went on to win the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, fixing De Niro’s status as a movie legend.

The film was a box-office failure and proved to be a difficult experience for Scorsese. The next year, he focused his filmmaking talents on the music industry outright. His acclaimed documentary called The Last Waltz showcased the farewell performance of The Band, with guest performances by Van Morrison, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/bob-dylan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bob Dylan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bob Dylan</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/muddy-waters data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Muddy Waters" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Muddy Waters</a>. In addition to being hailed as one of the greatest concert movies of all time, The Last Waltz was then spoofed in Rob Reiner’s landmark 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More Celebrated Directors</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Scorsese’s next film was the sports drama Raging Bull (1980), which was based on the life of troubled boxer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/jake-lamotta data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jake LaMotta" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jake LaMotta</a>.

De Niro won an Oscar for Best Actor for his performance as LaMotta.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Abandoning thoughts of leaving the industry, Scorsese continued to make films through the 1980s. He partnered again with De Niro for the dark comedy The King of Comedy (1982) about an aspiring comedian dangerously obsessed with a famous comic (played by Jerry Lewis).
