Seen all over the sidewalks surrounding New York Fashion Week, these hair accessories constantly prove their versatility. They can be glammed up or styled down, and worn by people of all hair types — so long as you opt for the right clips, that is. After all, if you have thick strands, many clips just won’t cut it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help ensure that you don’t waste your money on unsatisfactory clips, we set out to find the best hair clips for thick hair. To do so, we chatted with a few celebrity hairstylists about what makes a great hair clip for thick hair, and researched the top-selling, most highly-rated clips the Internet has to offer. All in all, we found 10 hair clips that will support thick strands while elevating their style. Of these, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">TOCESS Big Hair Claw Clips</a> on Amazon are our top pick.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for the full list of the 10 best hair clips for thick hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-tocess-big-hair-claw-clip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TOCESS Big Hair Claw Clip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tocess Big Hair Claw Clips" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/p_N6CqC3Zjv37sykw22ThkgjtPA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tocess-big-hair-claw-clips-8f217029d9744d3abf227376765e6bd0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">TOCESS Big Hair Claw Clips, which are 4.33 inches long, are sold in sets of four. There are 18 color combos to choose from, with 10 sets sold in a single color, and eight in a variety of colors. While most of the clips are available in a matte finish, there are five electroplated metallic sets for those that prefer a high-shine hair accessory. Enough of the aesthetic factor, though — what’s really impressive about these clips is that they’re scratch- and chip-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about them breaking down the way many other clips do. They’re also designed with long, thick hair in mind: Each clip has 18 claws to firmly grip hair without creating excess tension. It’s truly no wonder they’ve accumulated over 21,000 five-star reviews on Amazon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>18 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Plastic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>Long hair of all textures</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-claw-clip-teleties-large-hair-clip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Claw Clip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Teleties Large Hair Clip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Teleties Large Hair Clip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mvkEWXAaBC_SBUPBRZLzW23kN94=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/TeletiesLargeHairClip1-5805c2360ded4897b71ed137522980fd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Teleties might be best known for their spiral hair ties, but the brand’s new claw clips are something to marvel at. The 4.5-inch Teleties Large Hair Clip is unique in that it’s made of lightweight, flexible plastic that’s molded into angled, tapered claws to expertly hold thick hair in place for a comfortable, slip-proof ‘do. As of right now, the new clips are sold in eight colors, though most of them are neutral and/or pastel, so we hope they decide to expand the line to include a few brighter hues (like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Barbiecore pink</a>!).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>8 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Flexible Plastic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>All hair lengths and textures</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-jumbo-claw-clip-framar-large-claw-clips-for-thick-hair></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Jumbo Claw Clip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Framar Large Claw Clips</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Framar Large Claw Clips for Thick Hair" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fd8Jbx3nIgavxGLhvsHZoM_1eyE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/FramarLargeClawClipsforThickHair1-bf295405e3bb4de482c3bbeed88ee34f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Very similar to the TOCESS claw clips, Framar Large Claw Clips for Thick Hair feature a cylindrical shape, albeit a touch longer.

Sold in sets of six, the mini claw clips measure one inch long and feature claws that can easily support thick hair, whether it’s straight or curly. Beyond their effective design, these clips have one of the best color and pattern selections of all the options we researched. The sets are sold in seven colors, often with three pairs of varying colors in each. (Though, some sets feature six different clips.) Where the Cream set is a classic, with various duos of glossy tortoiseshell claws, the Slate set is comprised of six different complementary clips (which, thanks to their colors, are especially stunning for fall).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>7 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Acrylic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>All hair textures and lengths</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-claw-clip-for-curly-hair-pattern-by-tracee-ellis-ross-hair-clip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Claw Clip for Curly Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross Hair Clip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross Hair Clip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jdQ_Ge94FILZqVdIwlF8dJXGVXM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PatternbyTraceeEllisRossHairClip-f8cfd321e5f34804ab5129a9cbe70a7c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have super curly hair, a spacious clip that gives your coils room to breathe while still styling them is ideal. According to celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Sunnie Brook</a>, the very best claw clip for curly hair is the Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross Hair Clip, which has 15 long, thin teeth. “It’s extra wide with a super strong spring, and it’s amazing for curly, full-bodied hair,” she explains. While it looks like a mini sculpture for your hair, we do wish it came in more colors so we could wear it for different occasions.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>1 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Acetate<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>Curly hair of all lengths</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-alligator-clip-framar-gator-grip-clips></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Alligator Clip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Framar Gator Grip Clips</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Framar Gator Grip Clips" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kIHMjTsybxLpewSMZ1rxbNW1Il8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/FramarGatorGripClips1-fe656f270cbe4a7faefebeb13e0e5071.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the biggest challenges for folks with thick hair is styling it. After all, with such heavy strands, they can take forever to blowdry, straighten, and curl. The easiest way to speed up the process is to section your hair with alligator clips, which are designed not to leave kinks.

With this in mind, the Mistofu Classic Large Snap Barrettes, which are sold in sets of three, top the category thanks to their 4.13-inch length, which includes 3.14-inch metal clips to hold ample hair.

If you have thick hair, Lee says you’ll want to opt for a large clip designed to hold more hair. With that in mind, he recommends the Kitsch XL Snap Clips, which have earned over 1,700 five star Amazon reviews. Sold in sets of two, the clips are 3.5 inches long and designed specifically with thick hair in mind.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And let it be known: There are many ways to style snap clips. “Whether it’s growing out your blunt bang or securing those layers into your pony, snap clips are not only for hiding layers,” Potempa says. “These can be incorporated into a half up style or a chic top knot as a fun way to accessorize your look to match your outfit.” And, if you prefer smaller snap clips to these larger ones, Potempa assures us that using multiple can be both functional and cool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>2 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Metal<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>Long hair of all textures</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bobby-pin-goody-slideproof-bobby-pins></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bobby Pin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Goody Slideproof Bobby Pins</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Goody Slideproof Bobby Pins" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/R-Sq4AE_bw-Nn3K6F_2P1yfQyok=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GoodySlideproofBobbyPins1-d5d3a72a13b14de2aa5ac3650116c559.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>They’re ho-hum style-wise, so they’re designed to be concealed, not boldly styled to stand out.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bobby pins are sold in various lengths but, according to Potempa, when it comes to thick hair, two-inch bobby pins are best. “Traditional one-inch bobby pins just will not hold and you’ll need double the amount,” she says. As such, Goody Slideproof Bobby Pins, which are two inches long and sold in two colors, not to mention packs of 48, are a no-brainer for thick hair. (Just ask the more than 12,000 Amazon shoppers who have given them their five-star seal of approval.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pro Tip: When using bobby pins, Lee says to make sure you’re inserting them correctly. “Most people think that bobby pins are supposed to go smooth side in, when in fact, it's the ridged side that needs to go inwards to hold the hair in place,” he says. “The smooth side will always slip out.” Another tip? Spritz the pin with hairspray before sticking it in. “Place it in when it's still a little wet and that will help hold thicker hair, as you need as much grip as possible,” Lee says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>2 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Metal<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>Hair of all textures and lengths</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-clip-emi-jay-big-effing-clip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge Clip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Emi Jay Big Clip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Emi Jay Big Effing Clip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9B6ZsSbqkMcq4o5cnFrnPvXh_ls=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Emi-Jay-Big-Effing-Clip-d6dbd5f787084db88da5221d6d5d5285.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Emi Jay</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Since the clips have thicker, closer-together claws, they’re not as accommodating for ultra-thick curly hair.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Emi Jay is the name behind arguably the most head-turning hair clips on the market.

It’s easier than you think, though — at least if you opt for the classic use. “For my clients that have thick hair that easily slips, I suggest pulling hair into a ponytail and then twisting it up and securing with a claw,” Brook says. “This will keep the hair pulled together and provide added support since heavy hair can tend to sag or slip.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you can simply twist your hair up or down and clip it into place, there’s also the option to check out the many claw clip hacks on Instagram and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>TikTok</a> (which have gotten upwards of 25 million views).
