The show, which gathers former contestants from the franchise in an idyllic location in Mexico, has already thrown out a few shocks, and while these have all been fresh to the viewer, to the contestants it’s all old news as the series is filmed months prior to its release.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>The show follows a familiar format, although there are some changes from its parent series. There’s an uneven number of men and women from previous iterations of The Bachelor/The Bachelorette, and every week one of the genders takes control of the famous rose ceremony, giving out the flower to people they feel strongly attracted to. Roseless contestants are sent home until strong couples are formed, at which point they decide to either get engaged or break up.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>If you’re a fan of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bartender Wells Adams</a> and company, and have been wondering when Bachelor in Paradise 2023 was filmed, then read ahead to find out!</p><h2 id=h-when-was-bachelor-in-paradise-2023-filmed data-injectable=false>When was Bachelor in Paradise 2023 filmed?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bachelor-in-Paradise-Season-9-Cast.png><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>Filming for the ninth season of Bachelor in Paradise began on June 6 2023, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as per showbiz gossip site Cheat Sheet</a>. This means dedicated fans were well aware of the identities of many of the contestants before they were officially revealed, although the producers did manage to keep some things under wraps, especially as some were allegedly brought to Mexico but didn’t end up appearing in the show, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">explained by blogger Reality Steve on the Daily Roundup podcast</a>:</p><p>“Because they’re there doesn’t necessarily mean they are going to be part of the first cast. There are people that they are bringing to Mexico who will sit in a hotel room for maybe a week, they could sit there two weeks. They could be brought in at the beginning of the season to a hotel in Mexico and never make it on. It’s happened before, more than once. Just because someone you see is heading down there does not necessarily mean they are going to be on the show.”</p><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=84 data-injectable=false>Filming wrapped up just two and a half weeks later on June 23, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">per Hidden Remote</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where was Bachelor in Paradise 2023 filmed?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rachel-Recchia-Bachelor-in-Paradise.jpg><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=false>This season of Bachelor in Paradise was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">filmed in Mexico</a> as usual.
