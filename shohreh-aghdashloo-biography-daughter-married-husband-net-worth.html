Her given name at birth is actually Shohreh Vaziri-Tabar. She only assumed the surname Aghdashloo after her first marriage. The actress was the only girl born in a family of six. Her father’s name is Anushiravan Vaziri-Tabar while her mother’s name is Effie. She also had three brothers named Shahran, Shahriar, and Shahrokh.</p><p>Shohreh Aghdashloo always wanted to act from a young age and despite her family’s opposition, she started acting at the age of 18. She began her acting career in the theatre and took part in many stage productions. She gave excellent performances and soon caught the eye of some prominent filmmakers in Iran. Shohreh landed her first film role in the 1977 movie, Gozaresh (The Report). The movie was hailed by critics and won an award at the Moscow Film Festival. Aghdashloo continued her exploits in other movies such as Shatranje Bad (Chess with the Wind) in 1977 and Sooteh Delan (Broken Hearts) in 1978.</p><p>Following the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the regime in Iran became more religiously strict. As such, Shohreh Aghdashloo and her fellow creative minds did not have the freedom to do the kind of movies they wanted. She, therefore, left Iran for England where she earned a degree in International Relations. She was subsequently offered a job at a newspaper but her love for acting took her to L.A. where she re-commenced her acting career. Her first Hollywood role came in 1989 in the movie Guests of Hotel Astoria. She followed it up with an appearance in NBC’s Matlock in 1990.</p><p>Since making her Hollywood debut, Shohreh Aghdashloo has featured in several movies and TV series. They include House of Sand and Fog, where she plays a courageous but obedient Iranian-American wife who is caught between obeying her husband’s wishes and following her conscience. Another one is the HBO/BBC miniseries,&nbsp;House of Saddam,&nbsp;where she portrays Saddam Hussein’s wife. Additionally, in the Syfy series, The Expanse, she plays the role of a high ranking U.N. official. Shohreh Aghdashloo is a woman of many firsts. She is the very first Middle Eastern woman to be nominated for an Oscar. This came in 2004 when she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role in House of Sand and Fog. She is also the first Iranian woman to win an Emmy. This was in 2009 for the series, House of Saddam.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-net-worth></span><strong>Her Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shohreh Aghdashloo has a net worth of $54 million. She is one of the richest celebrities in Iran and made her fortune from her illustrious movie career. It must be stated that the actress is no stranger to wealth as she originally came from a wealthy family in Iran. As aforementioned, Aghdashloo is an author. She released her debut effort in 2013. It is basically an autobiography and is titled The Alley of Love and Yellow Jasmines.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=husband-and-daughter-is-she-married></span><strong>Husband and Daughter, Is She Married?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Iranian-born actress has been hitched on two occasions. Her first marriage was in her native Iran in 1972. She was 18 years old at the time and tied the knot with Aydin Aghdashloo. Aydin Aghdashloo is a prominent Iranian painter, writer, and film critic. Their union did not produce any children and they divorced in 1979 when the actress left Iran.</p><p>The Expanse star is now married to Houshang Touzie. Touzie is an actor and a playwright. They got married in 1987. The couple collaborated together especially in the early stages of Aghdashloo’s career. They put up several plays which were targeted at Iranians living in the L.A. The couple has one child together, a daughter named Tara Jane Touzie. She regularly accompanies her mom to red carpet events. She has also followed in her parents’ footsteps and is a budding filmmaker.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuYpLWzscdmmKCglJbAqbjOqGSboZ%2Bcv6K8x7JknZmlnLW1sdFmpJqqop6ypXnHrqqbmZ6Zeq%2Bx02auqKqknXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./j-d-cannon-net-worth-73155.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>J.D.
